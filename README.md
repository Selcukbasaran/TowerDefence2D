# TowerDefence | 2D | Unity

## Description

I'm keeping this repo to refer if a beginner asks me how to start or how I started.
This is a simple Tower Defence game I made for my term project. 
My first experience with Unity. 
The game is not finished yet but I may not work on it anymore.
Feel free to take a look if you are new to Unity and C# and if you make any improvements, please make a pull request.

<b>Disclaimer</b>: As I said this is my first ever project in Unity. It was for my term project so don't expect it to guide you in any way.

## The Game Itself

You can play the game it is in the Game folder.

You can use WASD to move the camera and you can click on the areas that meant to place your tower(you can't miss it). 

The pause button does not stop the game. If you want to quit you can press the pause on the up left and click on the arrow facing left.

### Why No Assets?

I bought the assets [Craftpix.net](https://craftpix.net). I have build of with the game in Game folser. You can check it out if you want. 

### How did I start?

I first started with basic and went for the [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/). 

After that I started with [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbK_tjZ2OrIZFBvU6CCMiA) youtube channel. He also has a playlist for [Tower Defence Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0). I went through it for more project specific knowledge.

I also went through [Code Monkey's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeMonkeyUnity). 
He has a lot of tutorials on different topics.

<b>Big News:</b> He just dropped a full course for Unity. Its 10 hours long and its free. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg)
